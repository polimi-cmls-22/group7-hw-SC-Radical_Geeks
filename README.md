<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

<img src="screenshot.png" alt="Logo" width="700" height="350">

The user can congifure fm parameters thanks to some buttons and knobs.
The user can play from an external MIDI device or play our demo.
The user can load or save presets from CSV formatted files.

The CSV file must have the following structure:
The first four rows of the CSV file will control respectively the knobs of the four modulators in the following way:
1.	the first value of the i-th row sets the ratio of the i-th modulator (values must be in the [0.1, 20] range with step=0.5). 
2.	the second value of the i-th row sets the attack of the i-th modulator (values must be in the [0.001, 2] range with step=0.01). 
3.	the third value of the i-th row sets the release of the i-th modulator (values must be in the [0.1, 10] range with step=0.01). 
4.	the last value of the i-th row sets the index of the i-th modulator (values must be in the [0.1, 20] range with step=1). 
		
The fifth row will control the knobs of the carrier in the following way:
1.	the first value sets the panning of the master output (values must be in the [-1, 1] range with step=0.1). 
2.	the second value sets the master volume (values must be in the [0.001, 2] range with step=0.01).
3.	the third value sets the master attack (values must be in the [0.001, 2] range with step=0.01). 
4.	the last value sets the master release (values must be in the [0, 1] range). 

The sixth row will control the algorithm of the FMSynth:
1.	the first value (can be chosen between 0 and 1) determine whether the left path (modulators 1 and 3) will be active ('1') or not ('0').
2.	the second value (can be chosen between 0 and 1) determine whether the right path (modulators 2 and 4) will be active ('1') or not ('0').
3.	the third value (can be chosen between 0, 1 and 2) determine whether the modulator 3 is not active ('0') or its input comes from modulator 1 ('1') or from the carrier ('2').
4.	the fourth value (can be chosen between 0, 1 and 2) determine whether the modulator 4 is not active ('0') or its input comes from modulator 2 ('1') or from the carrier ('2')	

The only value of the last row will be used to select (between sine ('0'), triangle ('1') and sawtooth ('2')) the waveshape of the carrier.

Furthermore,  the user can create the FMSynth architecture that he likes the most. This can be done thanks to 4 buttons in the GUI: 
1. 'Left path active / Left path active inactive': Activation of the left feed forward chain (enabling/disabling the modulator 3, directly connected to the carrier).
2. 'Not active / Input from 1 / Feedback': Mode of operation of the left feed forward chain (choosing whether the input of the modulator 3 is no input or the output of modulator 1 or the carrier (feedback)).
3. 'Right path active / Right path active inactive': Activation of the right feed forward chain (enabling/disabling the modulator 4, directly connected to the carrier).
4. 'Not active / Input from 2 / Feedback': Mode of operation of the right feed forward chain (choosing whether the input of the modulator 4 is no input or the output of modulator 2 or the carrier (feedback)).

## Play demo
Thanks to the 'Play demo / Stop demo' button the user can listen to a demo song created by the Team, in order to let him hear what sounds can be created via the FMSynth.
DISCLAIMER: when the demo song is playing only the 'Master Volume' and 'Master Panning' knobs will be active.

## Real time scope and frequency scope
The user will have a real time feedback of what he's playing thanks to the Scope and Frequency scope windows placed to the right end of the GUI.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [✓] customizable FM synth
- [✓] you can save and load patterns
- [✓] you can use the FM synth as an instrument with a MIDI external device
- [✓] you can play our demo
- [✓] you can choose between a sinusoidal wave, a square wave or a sawtooth wave as carrier
- [✓] you can choose the synthesis parameters (ratio and index)
- [✓] you can setup the envelope (attack and release)
- [✓] you can set the panning
- [✓] you can view the time and frequency scope directly in the main window
